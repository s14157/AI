    "# 0. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing code is a fundamental skill in engineering, science, data analysis, and many other fields. However, coding is not just about typing lines of code. It also involves thinking through algorithms, debugging unexpected errors, and refining solutions. These steps can be time-consuming, especially for beginners who are still learning to navigate syntax, logic, and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Google Gemini act as *\"coding copilots\"* that help you write, understand, and debug code more efficiently. These tools, however, do not replace your thinking; instead, they support it. AI-assisted coding is becoming increasingly common across many disciplines. For example, civil engineers use it to automate simulations and data-analysis pipelines, mechanical engineers use it to prototype control algorithms more quickly, computer scientists use it to explore ideas and diagnose bugs faster, and researchers use it to produce cleaner, better-documented code.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI-assisted coding allows you to focus on logic, modeling, and decision-making, while automating repetitive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, just like numerical methods, AI-generated code comes with trade-offs. The output may be incomplete, subtly incorrect, or logically flawed. Knowing how to guide, evaluate, and revise AI-generated code is an essential modern skill. While it is important to learn how to leverage AI tools to support coding, it is equally, if not more important to critically assess their limitations and drawbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will cover the fundamentals of AI-assisted coding using GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant that helps you write code faster and more efficiently, and Google Gemini within Google Colab, which provides similar AI support in a cloud-based environment. We will explore the different features of GitHub Copilot and learn how to use them effectively to write and debug Python code. Additionally, we will see how Google Gemini can assist with coding directly in Colab, allowing for interactive development and experimentation in the cloud."

    "1. Python - This extension provides support for the Python programming language and includes IntelliSense, debugging, and Jupyter notebook support.\n",
    "2. Jupyter - This extension provides Jupyter notebook support within VS Code.\n",

    "- Visual Studio Code is a code editor that has extensions to allow you to code in various languages (i.e., Python) and to use GitHub Copilot.\n",
